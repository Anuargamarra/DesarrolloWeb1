        <h1>WHAT is XML?</h1> 
         <ul>
            <li><p>XML stands for E<b>X</b>tensible <b>M</b>arkup language</p></li>
            <li><p>XML is <b>markup language</b> much like HTML</p></li>
            <li><p>XML was designe to <b>describe data</b></p></li>
            <li><p>XML tags are not predefined.You must <b>desfine our own tags </b></p></li>
            <li><p>XML uses a <b>Document Type Definition</b> (DTD) or an <b>XML scheman</b> to describe the data</p></li>
            <li><p>XML whit a DTD or XML schema designe to be <b>self-descriptive</b></p></li>

           <h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>
           <h2>XML whas designe to carry data.</h2>
           <br>
           <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p>
           <p>XML and HTML were designe whit different goals:</p>
            <br>
           <p>XML was designe to describe data and to focus on what data is.</p>
           <p>HTML was designe to display data and to fous on how data looks</p>
           <br>
            <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information</p> 
           <hr>
           <h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>
           <h2>XML was not designe to DO anything</h2>

           <p>mabye it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created<br> to structure, store and to send information</p>
            <p>The following example is a note to Tove from jani, stored as XML:</p>


            <br>
            <p>The note has header and a message body. it also has sender and receiver information. <br> But still, this XML document does not DO anything. it is just pure information wrapped <br> is XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, recieve or display it. </p>
